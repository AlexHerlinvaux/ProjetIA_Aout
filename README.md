# ProjetIA_Aout
IA Project for August 2020 Exams

## How to use it

```bash
$ # Clone the git depository
$ # Open main.py in Spyder or any  other Python IDE
$ # Run main.py
```
If it's the first time the program is launched, it'll train for 10 000 iterations (May take up to several hours)
Then it'll make you play against the trained AI

You can train it further on next execution of main.py if you tell the program you want to train the IA (Train ? (y/n))
If you choose yes (y) then it'll train for 10 000 more iterations
If you choose no (n) you will be able to play against the AI at its current state of training
